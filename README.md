# GeneticAlgorithm
Copyright 2019 by Marco Costa

You are free to use my code however you want. Have at!

This is a Work In Progress and mostly made to help students understand how the base components of a Genetic Algorithm work aside from the fitness function.

This project is composed of two classes:

1. GeneticAlgorithm. This class provides all the base functionality of the Genetic Algorithm and is meant to be extended by child classes. These child classes use GeneticAlgorithm's main functions to some practical end.
2. MusicGA. This class evolves randomly generated melodies to classical Baroque sensibilities. (WIP)
