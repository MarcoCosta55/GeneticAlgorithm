# GeneticAlgorithm
Copyright 2019 by Marco Costa

You are free to use my code however you want. It'd be nice if you mention me if you decide to use it though...

I've created three classes:

1. A Base Genetic Algorithm. This class has no real practical function. Rather it provides all the base functionality
of the Genetic Algorithm and is meant to be extended by child classes. These child classes use the GA's main functions
to some practical end.
2. The String GA. This class tunes randomly created strings to evolve to the "perfect" user generated string.
3. The Music GA. This class tunes randomly generated melodies to classical Baroque sensibilities.
